                <p>Still here? Good. Youâ€™re about half way done with your degree. Donâ€™t give up because things are just starting to get interesting.
                    By now you should have taken a few programming classes, primarily, Computer Programming I and II. You might even be in CP II right now. Tough,
                    isnâ€™t it? But what do you do with your new found skills? You practice. A lot. </p>

                            <p>There are plenty of sites that you can go to. Projecteuler.net is a simple, straight forward site that we recommend. Sign up (itâ€™s free) and take a crack at the more than 500 math and logic problems they have offered up to their members. Donâ€™t feel too frustrated if you canâ€™t figure it out. They get really difficult. And donâ€™t cheat, because that doesnâ€™t help you learn.
                                If youâ€™re feeling more competitive, you can always go and test your skills against others on topcoder.com.</p>

                                GoogleDrive, and OneDrive are all good options. It really all comes down to personal preference and what is easiest to
                                integrate into your life. It would also help you out to have a Github account, as well as an account on StackOverflow.</p>
