                                offered with free 2 day shipping. Plus, Amazon is cheaper and safer than most online sources for supplies. Also, be sure to shop around when it comes to your textbooks. A large
                                portion of your semester costs will be in books, so do what you can to find them for the best price possible. And donâ€™t forget, you can sell them at the end of the semester if you
                                donâ€™t want to keep them. Treat them nice so you can get the most money out of them after youâ€™re done.</p>

                            <p>It is also a good idea to look into ninite.com. At ninite you can go through a list of software, including media, imaging, security, and developer tools and simply check the box next
                                to what you want and have it installed properly with no fuss or headaches. A suggestion though. Find out everything that you will need (eclipse, JDK, WinRAR to name a few) and install
                                them all at once with a single ninite installer file. That way, all you have to do is run that installer once every few weeks and it automatically checks for and installs updates to your

They get really difficult. And donâ€™t cheat, because that doesnâ€™t help you learn.
